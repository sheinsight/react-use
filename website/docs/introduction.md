# Introduction {#introduction}

`@shined/react-use` is an **SSR-friendly**, **comprehensive**, and **highly optimized** React Hooks library that delivers flexible and efficient hook solutions. Fully developed with **TypeScript**, it comes equipped with an interactive documentation filled with rich examples üî•.

Primarily inspired by [VueUse](https://vueuse.org/), along with influences from [react-use](https://github.com/streamich/react-use), [ahooks](https://ahooks.js.org/), and many other excellent libraries within the community. Huge thanks to the Open Source community, especially the authors of the libraries mentioned above, for their great work and inspiration.

- **Flexibility**: Features include [ElementTarget](/docs/features/element-target), [Ref Getter](/docs/features/ref-getter), [Pausable](/docs/features/pausable), and more.
- **Tree-shakable**: Designed and delivered with [ESM](https://nodejs.org/api/esm.html), import only what you need.
- **Interactive Documentation**: Interactive documentation with live examples and [Playground](https://react-online.vercel.app/#code=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%2BCiAgICA8L2Rpdj4KICApCn0KCmNyZWF0ZVJvb3QoZG9jdW1lbnQuZ2V0RWxlbWVudEJ5SWQoJ3Jvb3QnKSEpLnJlbmRlcig8QXBwIC8%2BKQo%3D).

## ‚ö°Ô∏è Optimizations {#optimizations}

- **Safe State**: Implements a [safe state](/docs/optimization/safe-state) strategy for all stateful Hooks, reducing bugs and unwanted behaviors.
- **Stable functions**: Every exported function benefits from [stabilization](/docs/optimization/stabilization) by default.
- **Latest State**: Avoids the expired closure issues by using [latest](/docs/optimization/latest-state) state internally.
- **Reduced Unnecessary Rerenders**: Use [Pausable](/docs/features/pausable) instance to control the behavior of some Hooks optionally.
