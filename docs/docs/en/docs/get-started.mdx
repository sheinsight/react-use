`@shined/react-use` aims to **reshape the new programming paradigm of React development**. It enhances development efficiency, fosters better programming habits, and reduces the reliance on `useEffect` and `useState` by offering a multitude of high-quality, semantic Hooks. It encourages developers to gradually adapt to a React development (programming) paradigm that prioritizes '**Hooks first**'.

Fundamentally, it's a **SSR (Server-Side Rendering) friendly**, **comprehensive**, and **highly optimized** React Hooks library that provides flexible and efficient Hook solutions, entirely developed in **TypeScript**, and comes with interactive documentation filled with rich examples üî•.

It's primarily inspired by [VueUse](https://vueuse.org/), while also drawing from [react-use](https://github.com/streamich/react-use), [ahooks](https://ahooks.js.org/), and many other outstanding libraries within the community. Special thanks to the open-source community, especially the authors of the aforementioned libraries, for their exceptional work and inspiration.

## üöÄ Features \{#features}

- **Flexibility**: [Dependencies Collection](/docs/features/dependencies-collection)„ÄÅ[ElementTarget](/docs/features/element-target), [Ref Getter](/docs/features/ref-getter), [Pausable](/docs/features/pausable), and more.
- **Tree-shakable**: Designed and delivered with [ESM](https://nodejs.org/api/esm.html), import only what you need.
- **Interactive Documentation**: Interactive documentation with live examples and [Playground](https://react-online.vercel.app/#code=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%2BCiAgICA8L2Rpdj4KICApCn0KCmNyZWF0ZVJvb3QoZG9jdW1lbnQuZ2V0RWxlbWVudEJ5SWQoJ3Jvb3QnKSEpLnJlbmRlcig8QXBwIC8%2BKQo%3D).
- **Lightweight**: Boasts [zero dependencies](https://github.com/sheinsight/react-use/blob/main/package.json).
- **SSR-friendly**: Ensures that all Hooks are compatible with Server-side Rendering (SSR).
- **First-class TypeScript Support**: Written in [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) with well-named type definitions and [JSDoc](https://jsdoc.app/) Comment.
- **~~Comprehensive Testing~~**: (Coming soon...)

Visit the [Get Started](/docs/get-started) section to explore how it can be integrated into your project.

## ‚ö°Ô∏è Optimizations \{#optimizations}

- **Safe State**: Implements a [safe state](/docs/optimization/safe-state) strategy for all stateful Hooks, reducing bugs and unwanted behaviors.
- **Stable functions**: Every exported function benefits from [stabilization](/docs/optimization/stabilization) by default.
- **Latest State**: Avoids the expired closure issues by using [latest](/docs/optimization/latest-state) state internally.
- **Reduced Unnecessary Rerenders**: Use [Pausable](/docs/features/pausable) instance to control the behavior of some Hooks optionally.

## üì¶ Installation \{#installation}

Install using your favorite package manager:

import { PackageManagerTabs } from 'rspress/theme'

<PackageManagerTabs
  command={{
    npm: 'npm install @shined/react-use',
    yarn: 'yarn add @shined/react-use',
    pnpm: 'pnpm add @shined/react-use',
    bun: 'bun add @shined/react-use',
  }}
/>

## üé® Usage Examples \{#usage}

Below is an example of how to use the [useAsyncFn](/reference/use-async-fn) Hook:

```tsx
function App() {
  const { loading, error, run } = useAsyncFn(fetchData)
  return (
    <>
      <div>{data}</div>
      <button onClick={run} disabled={loading}>Fetch</button>
    </>
  )
}
```

import { App } from '@/../../src/use-async-fn/demo'

<App />

Next, it is recommended to read [Getting Started](/docs/get-started) to understand how to use this library.

Then you can proceed to the [Usage Guide](/docs/guide) to learn how to improve existing code, or visit the [Hooks List](/reference) to see all available Hooks.
