`@shined/react-use` aims to **reshape the new programming paradigm of React development**. It enhances development efficiency, fosters better programming habits, and reduces the reliance on `useEffect` and `useState` by offering a multitude of high-quality, semantic Hooks. It encourages developers to gradually adapt to a React development (programming) paradigm that prioritizes '**Hooks first**'.

Fundamentally, it's a **SSR (Server-Side Rendering) friendly**, **comprehensive**, and **highly optimized** React Hooks library that provides flexible and efficient Hook solutions, entirely developed in **TypeScript**, and comes with interactive documentation filled with rich examples üî•.

It's primarily inspired by [VueUse](https://vueuse.org/), while also drawing from [react-use](https://github.com/streamich/react-use), [ahooks](https://ahooks.js.org/), and many other outstanding libraries within the community. Special thanks to the open-source community, especially the authors of the aforementioned libraries, for their exceptional work and inspiration.

## üöÄ Features \{#features}

- **Flexibility**: [Dependencies Collection](/docs/features/dependencies-collection)„ÄÅ[ElementTarget](/docs/features/element-target), [Ref Getter](/docs/features/ref-getter), [Pausable](/docs/features/pausable), and more.
- **Tree-shakable**: Designed and delivered with [ESM](https://nodejs.org/api/esm.html), import only what you need.
- **Interactive Documentation**: Interactive documentation with live examples and [Playground](https://react-online.vercel.app/#code=eNqNk02P0zAQhu%2F5FUMvSaS6aVdFWq2aClhx4AAHTiDEIbEnbYQ%2FItthE6L8d6ZJ191PaS%2F22H7nmfGMXavGWA8DcIuFx%2B%2FGeBihskZBTDvcM2FUxmWN2sdRULcOvxoalifr1rTaow1%2BH9yx1iiy2Z8EcRRVrea%2BNho%2BNk2SwhABcKPdidUtoSffPECTNJz%2B4if2EghEzu73rDoHTNZpREqLvrUaEjIBdqL%2BC1wWzn0rFObxHataKaEy2jNltIGDrQU0suDIKISnazFOA9p4PwFeQrxfr5sOPHb32tm%2B6mRweu6mSLCO98%2BKsctI%2BLrbRN52cg5RqJKiqZ5dx%2FsfNzB04xJ%2B0tyPTzFl673RYU0FDMyFpXoJFFAaKwg3T8wZSaU4L%2BZATce20PTsavEAZPStrPmffKC%2B5fv7VqxqzZNNOgbhJReAqUGU5tS9i2SXzVmGSj%2B8w5NCLO7Yhop%2BZI5eJmooD3OO2fYaipJybz3CP7ZZgPO9xHwYQGJFQTtgsIFxhOx18pl5nEK8gexNc0OP9DE4ZJ9GYxRd%2Fk8iDG8VvZPVAf1niSfzU%2F9FJLGl0zh9l64sUj9ssqPPQLQ0%2Bg%2BbPxib).
- **Lightweight**: Boasts [zero dependencies](https://github.com/sheinsight/react-use/blob/main/package.json).
- **SSR-friendly**: Ensures that all Hooks are compatible with Server-side Rendering (SSR).
- **First-class TypeScript Support**: Written in [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) with well-named type definitions and [JSDoc](https://jsdoc.app/) Comment.
- **Comprehensive Testing**: Each Hook is rigorously tested with [Vitest](https://vitest.dev/) to ensure reliability and stability.

Visit the [Get Started](/docs/get-started) section to explore how it can be integrated into your project.

## ‚ö°Ô∏è Optimizations \{#optimizations}

- **Safe State**: Implements a [safe state](/docs/optimization/safe-state) strategy for all stateful Hooks, reducing bugs and unwanted behaviors.
- **Stable functions**: Every exported function benefits from [stabilization](/docs/optimization/stabilization) by default.
- **Latest State**: Avoids the expired closure issues by using [latest](/docs/optimization/latest-state) state internally.
- **Reduced Unnecessary Rerenders**: Use [Pausable](/docs/features/pausable) instance to control the behavior of some Hooks optionally.

## üì¶ Installation \{#installation}

Install using your favorite package manager:

import { PackageManagerTabs } from 'rspress/theme'

<PackageManagerTabs
  command={{
    npm: 'npm install @shined/react-use',
    yarn: 'yarn add @shined/react-use',
    pnpm: 'pnpm add @shined/react-use',
    bun: 'bun add @shined/react-use',
  }}
/>

## üé® Usage Examples \{#usage}

Below is an example of how to use the [useAsyncFn](/reference/use-async-fn) Hook:

```tsx
function App() {
  const { loading, error, run } = useAsyncFn(fetchData)
  return (
    <>
      <div>{data}</div>
      <button onClick={run} disabled={loading}>Fetch</button>
    </>
  )
}
```

import { App } from '../../../../packages/react-use/src/use-async-fn/demo'

<App />
