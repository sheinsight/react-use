   */
  delayEnter?: number
  /**
   * Delay in milliseconds before the `onLeave` event is triggered
   */
  delayLeave?: number
  /**
   * Event handler when the mouse enters the target element
   */
  onEnter?: (e: MouseEvent) => void
  /**
   * Event handler when the mouse leaves the target element
   */
  onLeave?: (e: MouseEvent) => void
  /**
   * Event handler when the mouse enters or leaves the target element
   */
  onChange?: (isHovered: boolean, e: MouseEvent) => void
}
```

### Returns

A `boolean` value that indicates whether the target element is hovered.
