# useAsyncEffect

import { HooksType } from '@/components'

<HooksType {...frontmatter} />

A React Hook similar to [React.useEffect](https://react.dev/reference/react/useEffect), but supports **cancellable** **asynchronous** functions.

:::note Note

It should not return a cleanup function, as it is `async` and cannot synchronously return a cleanup function to be executed as expected.

If you need to clean up something, please use `isCancelled()` within `UseAsyncEffectCallback` to check the status of the Effect.

:::

## Scenes \{#scenes}

- **Asynchronous Data Request Scenes:** Implementing asynchronous data requests when the page loads or dependencies change
- **Status Update Monitoring Scenes:** Executing asynchronous state synchronization updates after dependency state updates
- **Resource Cleanup and Cancellation Scenes:** Implementing asynchronous operation cancellation and resource cleanup at the end of an Effect through `isCancelled()`
- ...

## Demo \{#demo}

import { App } from './demo'

<App />

## Usage \{#usage}

```tsx
useAsyncEffect(async () => {}, [state])


useAsyncEffect(async (isCancelled) => {
  // do something async
  
  if(isCancelled()) return
  
  // do something when effect is not cancelled
}, [state])
```

## Source \{#source}

import { Source } from '@/components'

<Source />

## API

```tsx
useAsyncEffect(asyncCallback, deps)
```

### AsyncCallback \{#async-callback}

An Effect callback that supports **asynchronous** functions, but does not support returning a cleanup function.

```tsx
export type AsyncEffectCallback = (isCancelled: () => boolean) => void

export type UseAsyncEffectCallback = AsyncEffectCallback
```

### Deps \{#deps}

The same as [React.useEffect](https://react.dev/reference/react/useEffect).
