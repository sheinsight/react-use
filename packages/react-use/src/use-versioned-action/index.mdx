# useVersionedAction

import { HooksType, Since } from '@/components'

<HooksType {...frontmatter} />

<Since version='v1.7.0' />

A low-level React Hook designed to facilitate the use of "versioned" actions, commonly employed in asynchronous scenarios for filtering operations to ensure only the latest action is executed.

## Scenes \{#scenes}

- **Asynchronous operation filtering**: Handling multiple asynchronous operations, executing only the latest operation, ignoring "expired" ones.

## Demo \{#demo}

import { App } from './demo'

<App />

## Usage \{#usage} 

When `doSomething()` is called consecutively, only the most recent operation is executed, avoiding "expired" operations that could lead to screen flicker or unexpected results.

```tsx
const [incVersion, runVersionedAction] = useVersionedAction()

const doSomething = async () => {
  // Increment the version number with incVersion()
  const version = incVersion()

  // Asynchronous operation, like fetching data
  const result = await fetchSomething()

  // Ensure only the latest action is executed with runVersionedAction()
  runVersionedAction(version, async () => {
    setResult(result)
  })
}
```

## Source \{#source}

import { Source } from '@/components'

<Source />

## API

```tsx
const [incVersion, runVersionedAction] = useVersionedAction()
```

### Returns \{#returns}

```tsx
export type UseVersionedActionReturns = readonly [
  /**
   * Increment the version number and return the current version number
   */
  incVersion: () => number,
  /**
   * Executes the versioned operation, only if the version number matches, ensuring that only the latest action is executed
   */
  runVersionedAction: <T extends AnyFunc>(version: number, handler: T) => ReturnType<T> | undefined,
]
```
