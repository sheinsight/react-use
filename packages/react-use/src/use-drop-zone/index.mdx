   */
  dataTypes?: string[] | ((types: readonly string[]) => boolean)
  /**
   * A callback that is called when the user drops files in the drop zone.
   */
  onDrop?: (files: File[] | null, event: DragEvent) => void
  /**
   * A callback that is called when the user drags files over the drop zone.
   */
  onEnter?: (files: File[] | null, event: DragEvent) => void
  /**
   * A callback that is called when the user drags files out of the drop zone.
   */
  onLeave?: (files: File[] | null, event: DragEvent) => void
  /**
   * A callback that is called when the user drags files over the drop zone.
   */

}
