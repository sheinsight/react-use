# useClamp

import { HooksType } from '@/components'

<HooksType {...frontmatter} />

A React Hook that clamps a number between a minimum and maximum value, supporting dynamic changes to the value, minimum, and maximum.

Essentially, it's a more semantic version of [useCounter](/reference/use-counter) with `min` and `max` options set.

## Scenes \{#scenes}

- **Handling Count Calculations:** Provides functionality for increasing, decreasing, setting, getting, and resetting counters.
- **UI Interaction Scenarios:** Implements dynamic updates and displays of quantities on user interfaces, such as the number of items in a shopping cart or carousel sliding.
- **Form Input Limitations:** Used for limiting the number range within forms or input fields.

## Demo \{#demo}

import { App } from './demo'

<App />

## Usage \{#usage}

```tsx
const [count, countActions] = useCount(20)
// The value to process is 20, the minimum is 1, and the maximum is 16
const [count, actions] = useClamp(count, 1, 16) 

// The result of count is 16 because 20 exceeds the maximum of 16
console.log(count)

// No matter the operations performed by countActions, the returned value of result always stays between 1 and 16

// Also supports all operations of useCounter for direct modification but is likewise constrained by min and max
actions.inc() 
actions.inc(2)
actions.dec()
actions.dec(2)
actions.set(10)
actions.reset()
actions.reset(12)
```
