# useClamp

import { HooksType } from '@/components'

<HooksType {...frontmatter} />

A React Hook that clamps a number between a minimum and maximum value, supporting dynamic changes to the value, minimum, and maximum.

Essentially, it's a more semantic version of [useCounter](/reference/use-counter) with `min` and `max` options set.

## Demo \{#demo}

import { App } from './demo'

<App />

## Usage \{#usage}

```tsx
const [count, countActions] = useCount(20)
// The value to process is 20, the minimum is 1, and the maximum is 16
const [count, actions] = useClamp(count, 1, 16) 

// The result of count is 16 because 20 exceeds the maximum of 16
console.log(count)

// No matter the operations performed by countActions, the returned value of result always stays between 1 and 16

// Also supports all operations of useCounter for direct modification but is likewise constrained by min and max
actions.inc() 
actions.inc(2)
actions.dec()
actions.dec(2)
actions.set(10)
actions.reset()
actions.reset(12)
```

## Scenes \{#scenes}

- Value control in user interface interactions (such as sliders, knobs), providing a better user experience
- Dynamic data display, ensuring that data stays within an acceptable range in the user interface
- Form input range control, preventing users from entering values beyond a predefined range
- Animation parameter constraints, ensuring that animation speed or position parameters do not exceed expected ranges
- Data visualization component parameter adjustments, such as restrictions on chart scaling levels
- ...
