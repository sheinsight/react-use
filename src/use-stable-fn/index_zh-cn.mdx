# useStableFn

import { HooksType } from '@/components'

<HooksType category="Utilities" lowLevel />

A React Hook that returns a function whose memory address will never change.

Try to increase the counter to update the component to trigger re-render, you will see that the function's memory address will never change, so the toast will never show up.

import { App } from './demo'

<App />

## Usage

import { RawCode } from '@/components'
import source from '!!raw-loader!./demo'

<RawCode>{source}</RawCode>

## Source

import { Source } from '@/components'

<Source />

## API

const stableFn = useStableFn(fn)
```

The function whose memory address will be stable.

A same shape function, but its memory address will never change.
