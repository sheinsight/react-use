# useStableFn

import { HooksType } from '@/components'

<HooksType {...frontmatter} />

A React Hook that returns a function whose memory address will never change.

## Demo

Try to increase the counter to update the component to trigger re-render, you will see that the function's memory address will never change, so the toast will never show up.

import { App } from './demo'

<App />

## Usage

See API for more details.

## Source

import { Source } from '@/components'

<Source />

## API

```tsx
const stableFn = useStableFn(fn)
```

### Fn

The function whose memory address will be stable.

### Returns

A same shape function, but its memory address will never change.
