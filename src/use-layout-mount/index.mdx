# useLayoutMount

import { HooksType } from '@/components'

<HooksType category="Lifecycle" />

import Link from '@docusaurus/Link'

A React Hooks that is similar to <Link to="/reference/use-mount">`useMount`</Link> but use <Link to="/reference/use-isomorphic-layout-effect">`useIsomorphicLayoutEffect`</Link> under the hood.

Usually, you should use `useLayoutMount` instead of `useMount` if you want to run some code that may affect the layout in the next frame.

## Demo

Try to click refresh multiple times, and you will see a layout jitter in the following `useMount` demo.

import { App } from './demo'

<App />

## Usage

import { RawCode } from '@/components'
import source from '!!raw-loader!./demo'

<RawCode>{source}</RawCode>

## Source

import { Source } from '@/components'

<Source />

## API


```tsx
useLayoutMount(callback, strictOnce)
```

### Callback

A `function` that will be called when the component mounts (useLayoutEffect), can be **async**.

### StrictOnce

:::warning

`strictOnce` option is **NOT** recommended as it [damages](https://react.dev/learn/synchronizing-with-effects#dont-use-refs-to-prevent-effects-from-firing) the original intention of React 18's strict mode.

:::

A `boolean` that indicates whether the handler should be called only once in React 18's [Strict Mode](https://react.dev/reference/react/StrictMode). Default is `false`.
