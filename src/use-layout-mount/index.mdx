import { HooksType, Since } from '@/components'

<HooksType {...frontmatter} />

## Demo

Open DevTools to see the logs.

import { App } from './demo'

<App />

## Usage

See API for more details.

## Source

import { Source } from '@/components'

<Source />

## API

```tsx
useLayoutMount(callback, strictOnce)
```

### Callback

A `function` that will be called when the component mounts (useLayoutEffect), can be **async**.

### StrictOnce

:::warning

`strictOnce` option is **NOT** recommended as it [damages](https://react.dev/learn/synchronizing-with-effects#dont-use-refs-to-prevent-effects-from-firing) the original intention of React 18's strict mode.

:::

A `boolean` that indicates whether the handler should be called only once in React 18's [Strict Mode](https://react.dev/reference/react/StrictMode). Default is `false`.
