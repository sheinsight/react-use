# useAsyncUpdateEffect

import { HooksType } from '@/components'

<HooksType category="Lifecycle" lowLevel />

A React Hook which is like [useAsyncEffect](/reference/use-async-effect) but **ignore the execution at first mount**.

:::note
It should not return a cleanup function as it's `async` which cannot cleanup as expected.

If you need to cleanup something, use `isCancelled` in `UseAsyncEffectCallback` instead to check effect status.
:::

## Demo

It will **NOT** execute at first mount before you toggle the status to trigger the effect to start the interval.

import { App } from './demo'

<App />

## Usage

import { RawCode } from '@/components'
import source from '!!raw-loader!./demo'

<RawCode>{source}</RawCode>

## Source

import { Source } from '@/components'

<Source />

## API

See [useAsyncEffect](/reference/use-async-effect/#api).
