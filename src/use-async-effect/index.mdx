# useAsyncEffect

import { HooksType } from '@/components'

<HooksType category="Lifecycle" />

A React Hook which is like [React.useEffect](https://react.dev/reference/react/useEffect) but support **cancellable** **async** function.

:::note
It should not return a cleanup function as it's `async` which cannot cleanup as expected.

If you need to cleanup something, use `isCancelled` in `UseAsyncEffectCallback` instead to check effect status.
:::

## Demo

Click fetch several times, and you will find that all **obsolete** action are ignored as expected.

import { App } from './demo'

<App />
