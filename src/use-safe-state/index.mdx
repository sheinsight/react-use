# useSafeState

import Admonition from '@theme/Admonition'
import { HooksType } from '@/components'

<HooksType {...frontmatter} />

A React Hook similar to [React.useState](https://react.dev/reference/react/useState), but suppresses false warning reports in `React <= 17` and includes an optional deep comparison feature (`deep`, default is `false`). It is designed as a safe and efficient alternative to `React.useState`.

For a detailed explanation of the advantages of `useSafeState`, see [Safe State](/docs/optimization/safe-state).

## Scenes \{#scenes}

- **State Management**: Used as a replacement for `React.useState`, to avoid false warning reports in `React <= 17`.
- **Performance Optimization**: Avoids unnecessary re-renders by deeply comparing new and old states (`deep` option, off by default).

## Demo \{#demo}

import { App } from './demo'

<App />

## Usage \{#usage}

```tsx
const [info, setInfo] = useSafeState({ name: 'Bob' }, { deep: true })

setInfo({ name: 'Amy' }) // Setting a new value will trigger a re-render
setInfo({ name: 'Amy' }) // Setting the "same" value again will not trigger a re-render when the deep option is enabled
```

## Source \{#source}

import { Source } from '@/components'

<Source />

## API

```tsx
const [state, setState] = useSafeState(initialState, options)
```

### InitialState \{#initial-state}

The initial value of the state, the same as [React.useState](https://react.dev/reference/react/useState).

### Options \{#options}

```tsx
export type UseSafeStateOptions = {
  /**
   * Deeply compares the new state with the old one before updating.
   * 
   * The state is only updated when the new state is "different" from the old one, to reduce unnecessary re-renders.
   *
   * @defaultValue false
   */
  deep?: boolean
}
```

### Returns \{#returns}

The same as [React.useState](https://react.dev/reference/react/useState).
